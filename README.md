# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is my tic tac toe project as part of the Odin Project curriculum. The main takeaways from this
were learning how to use modules / closures rather than depend on global code and exposed functions
that have to pass a bunch of parameters. 

Live preview is [here](newmanem23.github.io/tic-tac-toe/).
